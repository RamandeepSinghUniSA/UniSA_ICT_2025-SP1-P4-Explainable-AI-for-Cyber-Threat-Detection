Each section is coded to set the path so that the datasets are all expected to be in the main section.

Different sections are seperated for their own testing folders and the main section contains the current testing and implementations.

Models: Saved models that can be loaded from models.py

Tools: Test different tools such as Encoders and Cluster Visualisers. Includes a encoder.py file to import the different encoders. Currently the cluster visualisers don't have an import.

Archive: Contains the archived code from previous tests.

Reports: Contains the tests which are linked to some written reports (reports so far have been just for Capstone 1).

Models/saved_models: Contains saved models which are passed to the ensembler. Also has saved encoders for the Secondary Model.
